# Global Day of Code Retreat - Elm

This is a repository with a walking skeleton to get you started with Elm quickly.

## What do I do after cloning?

### Install Elm globally if you don't have it already

You can install Elm with NPM or Yarn using the included `package.json`.

```sh
npm install -g elm
```

```sh
yarn global add elm
```

If you don't install it globally you might run into errors while running elm-test.

### Try running Elm-Test

From your gdcr-elm directory:
```sh
elm-test
```

```sh
elm-test --watch
```

### Editing Elm
You might want to install Visual Studio Code.

And install the elm and elm-format extensions.

Add `"elm.formatOnSave": true,` to your settings.
